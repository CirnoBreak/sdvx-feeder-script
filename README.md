# sdvx-feeder-script

Python script for FreePIE to translate keypresses to analogue knobs in vJoy

FreePIE: http://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/

vJoy: http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install/download

Download SDVX-KB.py and load it into FreePIE with a vJoy controller set up and you're good to go, may have to reboot after installing vJoy, experience may vary. Edit loop delay and math values to your preference. 

Work in Progress: A tray app to replace FreePIE that just loads the script and a config.. whenever I get around to it.
