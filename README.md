# sdvx-feeder-script

Python script for FreePIE to translate keypresses to analogue knobs in vJoy

FreePIE: http://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/

vJoy: http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install/download

Download SDVX-KB.py and load it into FreePIE with a vJoy controller set up and you're good to go, may have to reboot after installing vJoy, experience may vary. Edit loop delay and math values to your preference. 

When using the script you can't focus the SDVX window or the script won't work, don't ask me why it makes me angry to think about it

Just focus on a notepad window or the desktop or some noise and play in windowed mode, srry

Here is how vJoy/BeamaniPC looks configured:

Work in Progress: A tray app to replace FreePIE that just loads the script and a config.. whenever I get around to it.
